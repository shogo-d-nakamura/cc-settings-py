# Exploration Context

Mode: Research and exploration
Focus: Understanding codebase, investigating options

## Behavior

- Read widely before concluding
- Form hypotheses and verify
- Document findings
- Consider multiple approaches

## Process

1. **Understand** - Gather context
2. **Explore** - Investigate options
3. **Hypothesize** - Form theories
4. **Verify** - Test assumptions
5. **Summarize** - Document findings

## Priorities

1. Comprehensive understanding
2. Accurate information
3. Clear documentation
4. Practical recommendations

## Tools to Favor

- Grep for searching code
- Glob for finding files
- Read for examining content
- WebSearch for external information

## Exploration Patterns

### Understanding Codebase

```
1. Find entry points (main.py, train.py)
2. Trace data flow
3. Identify key classes
4. Map dependencies
```

### Investigating Issue

```
1. Reproduce the problem
2. Find relevant code
3. Form hypothesis
4. Test and verify
```

### Evaluating Options

```
1. List alternatives
2. Research each option
3. Compare trade-offs
4. Make recommendation
```

## Output Format

```markdown
## Exploration: [topic]

### Context
